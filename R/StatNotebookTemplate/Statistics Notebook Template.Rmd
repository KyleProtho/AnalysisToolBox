# 1. Prep data
Load into SAS or R, merge datasets as needed, rename variables as needed, make new/derivative variables (ex. age from birthdate)

# 2, Check data
Double-check your N, check for impossible or unlikely values (indicative of error), cross-check variables for inconsistencies


# 3. Study variables
Descriptive statistics, counts for categorical variables, histograms for quantitative variables


# 4. Deal with missing data
Identify it, document reasons for missing data, compare participants who are missing data to those who are not, decide on exclusion (ex. If they are missing the primary exposure or outcome), impute missing data (an advanced skill)


# 5. Explore simple relations and assumptions
Correlation matrix, two-variable plots for relationship of interest, plots to test assumptions


# 6. Prepare a descriptive table

# 7. Test the main hypothesis or hypotheses
Run formal statistical tests, run regression models, generate p-values and confidence intervals


# 8. Build final models and accompanying graphics
Check model assumptions, focus on data presentation, build accompanying graphics


# 9. Perform sensitivity analyses
Run models with and without outliers, try different values for the parameters, try different ways of imputing missing data


# 10. Prepare final code documents
Data creation (usually the longest), final tables and figures, additional analyses
